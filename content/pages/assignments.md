Course Assignments

    Two written weekly questions/comments, on one or more reading from the week's assignment, directed toward the class for the purposes of stimulating class discussion, and pointing toward particular passages of the reading under discussion. Due Tuesdays in class (not accepted late). Introduction to one of the plays under discussion and its censorship history. This will include a brief bibliography and notes of major points. An example will be provided during Week #2.
